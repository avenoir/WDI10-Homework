				<div class="overlayInfo">Turing showed remarkable ability in Mathematics and Science at an early age. At the age of 14 he could solve advanced problems without having even studied elementary calculus. Aged 16, he came across Albert Einstein’s work. Turing not only grasped his work but also extrapolated Einstein’s questioning of Newton’s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</div>

				<div class="overlayInfo">In 2009, Liberal Democrat MP, John Graham-Cumming started an online petition calling for an official apology from the government for prosecuting Alan Turing as a homosexual. The petition received thousands of signatures. On September 10, Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologized for the then government and described the treatment given to Turing as “utterly unfair”.</div>

				<div class="overlayInfo">In 1936 Turing published a paper in which he came up with the idea of the Universal Turing machine which was capable of computing anything that was computable. Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.</div>

				<div class="overlayInfo">It is often mistaken that the iconic image of Apple logo, with the apple being half eaten, is homage to Alan Turing. The man responsible for the design has said that the apple was bitten just to make sure people didn’t mistake it for a cherry. According to Stephen Fry, although Steve Jobs also confirmed that it wasn’t an intentional reference to Turing, he added “God, we wish it were.”</div>

				<div class="overlayInfo">On June 8, 1954 Alan Turing was found dead by his cleaner. The cause of his death was cyanide poisoning. A half-eaten apple was found besides his bed. Although the apple was never tested for cyanide, it is speculated that it was the means through which Alan committed suicide. Turing showed no sign of despondency before his death and several people including Turing’s mother believe that he consumed cyanide by accident and that it was not a case of suicide.</div>
