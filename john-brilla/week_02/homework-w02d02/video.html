		<h3>Lecture</h3>
		<p>Herbert Marshall Mcluhan (*1911 - +1979) lecture recorded by ABC Radio National Network on 27 June 1979 in Australia. 
		For the best resource collection of his work check out the page Mcluhan on Maui (MOM) here: http://www.mcluhanonmaui.com/
		The best documentary about Mcluhan (in four parts) is definitely CBC's Life and Times: Understanding Mcluhan here: 
		part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvpPb8...
		People seriously studying his work I can point to Douglas Hofstaedter. His work resembles Mcluhan's understanding on the basic mechanics behind the mind: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8m7lF... 
		Further elaboration on the process chiasmus upholds for analogy and the role of metaphor as linguistic device under-grinding its mechanics might find ample references in Patricia's Phd Paper Chi-thinking: Chiasmus and cognition here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/19115184/Ch...
		Note that she departs from Mark Turner's assumption of the parable as a substitute for chiasmus. 
		Then of course there is the great Noam Chomsky who Mcluhan mentiones in his letters as "stuffing language into grammar". Transcripts of his theories on language and the mind can be found here: http://hotbookworm.wordpress.com/cate...</p>
