		<p>Yukihiro Matsumoto, (a.k.a. Matz, born 14 April 1965) is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI).</p>
		<h4>Why does Joel love this guy?</h4>
		<p>Because he says things like this, that sound exactly like they came from Joels mouth.</p>
		<p><strong><em>"Because of the Turing completeness theory, everything one Turing-complete language can do can theoretically be done by another Turing-complete language, but at a different cost. You can do everything in assembler, but no one wants to program in assembler anymore."
		</em></strong></p>
		<p>We have often heard Joel refer to coding for humans and a similar attitude can be found among Matz's quotes and the content of his work.</p>
		<p><strong><em>"Most of the tasks we do are for humans. For example, a tax calculation is counting numbers so the government can pull money out from my wallet, but government consists of humans."</em></strong></p>
		<p><strong><em>"People are different. People choose different criteria. But if there is a better way among many alternatives, I want to encourage that way by making it comfortable. So that's what I've tried to do."</em></strong></p>
		<p><strong><em>"Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."</em></strong></p>
