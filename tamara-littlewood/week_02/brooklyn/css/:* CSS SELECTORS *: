/* CSS SELECTORS */

1. EVERYTHING ON THE PAGE
*

* {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}

can be used with child selectors

#container * {
	border: 1px solid black;
}

This will target every single element that is a child of the of the #container div



2. ID target single element by id
#x


#container {
	width: 960px;
	margin: auto;
}




3. CLASS target multiple elements / groups
.x


.error {
	color: red
}




4. DECSENDANT - specific, links in lists

X Y

li a {
	text-decoration: none;
}





5. TYPE - elements according to type

a {
	color: red;
}

ul {
	margin-left: 0;
}





6. X:visited and X link

a:link { color: red; }
a: visited { color: purple; }

use : visited psuedo class for visited links





7. X + Y

ul + p {
	color:  red;
}

This is an adjacent selector. Only the element that is immediately preceded by the former element

In this case, only the first paragraph after each ul will have red text


8. X > Y

div#container > ul {
	border: 1px solid black;
}

the different between the standard X Y and X > Y is that the latter will only select direct Children. For examole consider the following markup

<div id="container">
<ul>
	<li> List item
		<ul>
			<li> Chile </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> list item </li>
		<li> list item </li>
		<li> list item </li>
	</ul>
</div>

a selector of #contaner > ul will only target the uls which are direct choldren of the div with an id container. It will not target  the ul that is a child of the first li


9. X ~ Y

ul ~ p {
	color: red;
}

The sibling combinator is similar to X + Y however it is less strict.
While an adjacent selector is (ul + p) will only select the first element that is imdideatly preceded by the former selector this one is more generalised. 
It will select referring to our example above any p element as lon as they follow a ul



10. X[title]

a[title] {
	color: green;
}

Referred to as an attributes selector, in our exaample avvoe it will only selectt he anchor tags that have a title attribute
Anchor tags which do no will receive this paticlatr style 


11. X[href="foo"]


12. X[href*="nettuts"]

13. X[href^="http"]
