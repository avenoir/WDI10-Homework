	<h3 class="triviah">The Apple Logo</h3>
	<div class="ptrivia">
		<p>It has been said that Turing's work in busting the Enigma code shortened the Second World War by two years. But for various reasons, the work of Turing and his colleagues was kept secret by the British until 1974.

		In January 1952, Alan Turing's house got robbed. He told the police that he suspected the robber to be a friend of his boyfriend. At that time, homosexuality was a criminal offence in the United Kingdom.

		He committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide. Indeed, a half-eaten apple was found in his apartment.</p>

		And was it because he was a homosexual, and as a salute to Gay Pride, that the Apple logo from 1976 to 1999 also incorporated a horizontal band of rainbow colours?

		No. Stephen Fry asked Steve Jobs, one of the founders of Apple, whether this urban myth was true. Steve Jobs replied, "God, we wish it were."</p>

	<h3 class="triviah">Monopoly - Alan Turing Edition</h3>
	<div class="ptrivia">
		<p>This version of the famous property game was developed from an original board designed by William Newman, son of Turing's mentor, Max, over sixty years ago. The spaces, Community Chest Cards, and Chance Cards tell the story of Alan Turing's life. Photos of the Turing family adorn the game board. Alan Turing's face is on the play money.</p>
