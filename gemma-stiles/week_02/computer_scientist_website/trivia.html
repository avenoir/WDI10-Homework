<h1>Trivia</h1>
<h2><p>#1 His father worked for the Indian Civil Service</p></h2>
<h4><p>Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London on June 23, 1912. The site of his birth is commemorated by a blue plaque. His father worked for the Indian Civil Service (ICS). His parents had to travel between England and India often and they left Turing and his elder brother in the care of a retired Army couple.</p></h4>
<h2><p>#2 Alan Turing laid the foundation for central computers</p></h2>
<h4><p>He showed early signs of his genius
Turing showed remarkable ability in Mathematics and Science at an early age. At the age of 14 he could solve advanced problems without having even studied elementary calculus. Aged 16, he came across Albert Einstein’s work. Turing not only grasped his work but also extrapolated Einstein’s questioning of Newton’s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.</p></h4>
<h2><p>#3  Alan Turing had to undergo chemical castration because he was gay</p></h2>
<h4><p>In 1952, during an investigation, Alan Turing admitted that he had sexual relationship with Arnold Murray. At that time homosexual acts were illegal in The United Kingdom and both were subsequently charged with gross indecency. On March 31, 1952 Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, on the condition that he underwent hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido (chemical castration). Turing accepted the latter. The treatment, which went on for a year,rendered Turing impotent and caused gynecomastia.</p></h4>
<h2><p>#4   British PM apologized for treating Turing unfairly during his time</p></h2>
<h4><p>In 2009, Liberal Democrat MP, John Graham-Cumming started an online petition calling for an official apology from the government for prosecuting Alan Turing as a homosexual. The petition received thousands of signatures. On September 10, Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologized for the then government and described the treatment given to Turing as “utterly unfair”.</p></h4>
<h2><p>#5  Whether he committed suicide is debated</p><h2>
<h4><p>On June 8, 1954 Alan Turing was found dead by his cleaner. The cause of his death was cyanide poisoning. A half-eaten apple was found besides his bed. Although the apple was never tested for cyanide, it is speculated that it was the means through which Alan committed suicide. Turing showed no sign of despondency before his death and several people including Turing’s mother believe that he consumed cyanide by accident and that it was not a case of suicide.

<h2><p>#6   The Apple logo is not related to Turing though Jobs wished it was</p></h2>
<h4><p>It is often mistaken that the iconic image of Apple logo, with the apple being half eaten, is homage to Alan Turing. The man responsible for the design has said that the apple was bitten just to make sure people didn’t mistake it for a cherry. According to Stephen Fry, although Steve Jobs also confirmed that it wasn’t an intentional reference to Turing, he added “God, we wish it were.”</p></h4>
<h2><p>#7  TIME named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the Century</p></h2>
<h4><p>Since 1966, the Turing Award is given annually for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered as the equivalent of Nobel Prize in the computing world. In 1999, Time Magazine named Turing as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century. In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC nationwide poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. On 23 June 2001, a statue of Alan Turing was unveiled in Sackville Park, Manchester. The statue depicts Turing holding an apple – a symbol which represents forbidden love, the object that inspired Newton’s theory of gravitation and the assumed means by which Turing killed himself.</p></h4>
