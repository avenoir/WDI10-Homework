	<h1>Morphogenesis</h1>
	<h2><p>noun</p> 
		<p>1. the development of form and structure in an organism during its growth from embryo to adult</p>
		<p>2. the evolutionary development of form in an organism or part of an organism</h2></p>
		<h4><p>Alan Turing’s accomplishments in computer science are well known, but lesser known is his impact on biology and chemistry.</p>
		<p>In his only published paper on biology, "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis", Turing descries the way in which non-uniformity (natural patterns such as stripes, spots and spirals) may arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state. The theory (which can be called a reaction–diffusion theory of morphogenesis), has served as a basic model in theoretical biology, and is seen by some as the very beginning of chaos theory.</h4></p>
